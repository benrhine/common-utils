 * List of directories and / or files to exclude from COVERAGE metrics. To be explicit, items included in this list will
 * be excluded from Sonar coverage metrics BUT will still be analyzed. To state a different way this is not excluding
 * items in the list from being checked against Sonar standards, it is just excluding them from test coverage metrics.
 * IE. We dont want it saying that our tests need tests.
 * <p></p>
 * For a list of available properties that can be configured see the following documentation ...
